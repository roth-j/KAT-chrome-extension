## Purpose
While working on FE development, pages sometimes freeze and lock up the chrome tab. You could close the tab, or even more annoying go into the task manager and kill the process, but now you can simply click a button, kill the tab, and reload.

This was made just for the benefit of my own sanity while coding so that I could have an easier time dealing with hung tabs in Chrome.
